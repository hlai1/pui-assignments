            <div class="description">
                With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, millions of people shifted to a fully remote work environment, and while the health crisis has changed a lot in the last two years, many companies have opted to continue the trend of providing employees with the flexibility of remote or hybrid work. However, with this shift, workers report a lack of human connection, communication, and productivity. What used to be a question that could be addressed in a couple minutes with a colleague nearby was now reduced to a single ping on messages online. Our solution was to create an online slack add-on extension called Gauge Me, which would allow coworkers to complete daily check-in forms, utilize emotional recognition and emerging NLP technology to analyze the responses, and provide managers with the tools to consolidate the form responses into digestible data to improve work conditions and project set-ups moving forward.

                Gauge Me is a proposed Slack add-on designed for companies with employees working from home. Despite being almost three years out from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses and companies are still employing a hybrid or even fully-remote work environment. There are undoubtedly benefits to working from home, but one imperative challenge is the lack of human connection and interaction. Many people find it harder communicate effectively, and ask for help when needed.
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Thus, Gauge Me was borne to help with just that. The product targets two user groups: coworkers and managers. Coworkers provide feedback through daily check-in forms on their wellbeing, productivity, questions, and tasks. Think of it like a virtual stand-up meeting. Managers receive the feedback in an analyzable form, and can use that feedback to check in on employees. In the long term, they can use the conglomerate employee satisfaction data to improve future projects and team organization.

            <div class="description">
                The feedback forms utilize Natural Language Processing to process the data given by employees. Sentiment analysis and emotional recognition can be used to first, tokenize the data, then recognize groups of words or keywords that pair with emotions and feelings, and finally, generalize that data to create visual graphics that are easier to process for managers.

            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Companies like Hey Taco, Karma, and Yerbo attempt to bridge the gap between feeling and communicating. Hey Taco allows employees to give other employees virtual tacos everyday to show their gratitude, and to recognize small victories and huge accomplishments. Karma utilizes an anonymous feedback form with metrics to help people say ‘thank you’ to other people more often, and to connect with each other. Yerbo utilizes results from weekly surveys to translate mental well-being feedback into insights about a team’s burnout risk. Despite all these competitors, Gauge Me is unique in the sense that it collects day-to-day data and creates a history of data for managers to look back on. Managers can easily look at their summary data from the past day, week, month, and year, to see how company satisfaction and well-being has changed.

                The end result of Gauge Me changes work-from-home life on three ends. First, there’s increased communication between management and subordinates. Secondly, Gauge Me promotes well-being as it allows employees to express sentiments and wellbeing on a daily basis. Finally, it enables further growth by paving the way for better project planning and implementation and team building. Employees feel heard, and managers see progress.
