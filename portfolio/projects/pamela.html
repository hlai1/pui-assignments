                Pamela’s Diner is a well-known breakfast chain in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While known for their Lyonnaise potatoes and delicious pancakes (even recognized by former President Obama), their website is outdated. As part of a Web Development Project for my Information Systems Milieux Class, 67-250, at Carnegie Mellon, I was tasked with creating a more modern, up-to-date website for the local diner, updating aspects such as the company’s color scheme, logo, website layout, and more.

                This site is built intentionally and carefully, with clear font sizes, a consistent color scheme, and ease of navigation emphasized throughout. When the user lands on the main page, they’ll notice the large, newly designed Pamela’s Diner logo and their motto. There’s a picture of one of their stores on the main page to draw the user in and provide visual stimulation. On the other four pages, I utilized subtitles and headers to break up the information and make the page more readable. I also consistently used sized and formatted body text to increase readability. The two most important areas of the website to increase ease of navigation are located at the top for easy access. The top of the website has the fixed menu and search bar so the user doesn’t have to scroll all the way up to move pages and there is no need for extra links in the footer. The footer on the right hand side contains all the important information so users can easily contact Pamela’s Diner in Shadyside, and the clickable logo allows for easy navigation back to the main page. The main objective of the organization was clear headings to organize information (hence, the Google Maps of the diner is under the Location page). Minimal, if any, information is redundant on the website, and important information (such as Pamela’s contact information) is accessible on each and every page.

                After over 2,200 lines of code in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, the interactive website prototype for Pamela’s Diner was created. The prototype contained over 5 webpages, a search bar, clickable icons, expanding accordion content, feedback forms, and more.

                Based on the two user interviews, it seemed like they agreed that the website was, for the most
                part, easy to navigate, with clear headers and good balance between visuals and text. Both users
                thought the color scheme needed to be changed and hours of operation needed to be labeled more
                clearly, so I made the color scheme less bright and added hours of operation to the footer on
                every page. I also changed the Customer Reviews page to have user profile pictures. If I had
                more time, I’d make the search bar functionality more useful so you could actually search for
                items throughout the website and menu items as well. I would also create a more animated
                website–elements could slide onto the page or the navigation bar could expand or minimize off
                the side of the page.
